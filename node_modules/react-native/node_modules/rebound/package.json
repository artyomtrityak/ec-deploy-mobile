Itâ€™s now been adopted by several\nother Android applications. This JavaScript port was written to provide a quick\nway to demonstrate Rebound animations on the web for a conference talk. Since\nthen the JavaScript version has been used to build some really nice interfaces.\nCheck out [brandonwalkin.com](http://brandonwalkin.com) for an example.\n\n###OVERVIEW\n\nThe Library provides a SpringSystem for maintaining a set of Spring objects and\niterating those Springs through a physics solver loop until equilibrium is\nachieved. The Spring class is the basic animation driver provided by Rebound.\nBy attaching a listener to a Spring, you can observe its motion. The observer\nfunction is notified of position changes on the spring as it solves for\nequilibrium. These position updates can be mapped to an animation range to\ndrive animated property updates on your user interface elements (translation,\n    rotation, scale, etc).\n\nCheck out the [docco](http://facebook.github.io/rebound-js/docs/rebound.html),\n[tests](http://facebook.github.io/rebound-js/browser_test/index.html), and\n[examples](http://facebook.github.io/rebound-js/examples) for more details.\n",
